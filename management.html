                    As an engineer and an individual contributor for a longtime, I was always on the technical career ladder. I was always quite frustrated
                   about the slower career growth rate  in a technical career ladder. As a person who is highly reflective by nature I started going under the rabbit hole to figure out
                   the science behind management. I later ended up finding lots of things which helped me understand the facts and gave me some sort of piece of mind because the 6th sense which was giving me an instinct on bad management on several occasions was actually correct.
                    Long long ago In 1987, <a class="kesari-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.nap.edu/read/18890/chapter/4">National Research council had defined management of technology</a> as : -
                </p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    Management of Technology links between engineering , science and management disciplines to plan, develop, and implement technological capabilities to shape and accomplish
                    the strategic and operational objective of the organization.
                </blockquote>
                <p class="lead text-justify">
                    So the conclusion is how well you mange technology is all depends on how well you have strengthened the linkage between disciplines.
