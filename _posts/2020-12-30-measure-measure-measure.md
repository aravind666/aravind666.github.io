Measurement is the first step toward improvement—but only if you’re measuring the right things.

Early in my career, I made the same mistake many leaders make: I **optimized for what was easy to measure**, not what actually mattered.

**Goodhart's Law:**

> *"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."*

In software teams, metrics like story points, lines of code, or hours logged are seductive because they’re visible. But they **distort behavior**, **reduce quality**, and **undermine trust**.

I’ve seen teams **inflate output**, **avoid reuse**, and **sacrifice testability**—all to satisfy metrics that had little correlation with customer value.

## What Actually Matters

The most valuable indicators are also the hardest to measure:
- Reliability
- Trustworthiness
- Collaboration
- Growth mindset
- Code quality
- Humility
- Ownership

Teams strong in these areas can deliver almost anything.

## Leadership Lesson

If you **instrument the wrong metrics**, you **optimize the wrong behaviors**. Effective leaders **diagnose deeply**, **measure wisely**, and **resist false precision**.

What you measure doesn’t just track performance—it **shapes culture**.
