<p>Dear readers, Building a scalable application that has high availability is not easy. With this post I would like to describe few techniques that could help you to improve your 
application availability </p>
<p>I learnt some of these techniques from my experiance as well as from the talks of the Cloud Strategist and Thought leaders like Dan North, Lee Atchison, Ryan Tomayko  </p>
<p><b>The two most important characteristics which makes your product distinct are  </b>
	<ul>
		<li>Availablity : - Ability of the system to meet bussines goals by being operational </li>
		<li>Reliability : - Quality of the operation performed by the system </li>
	</ul>
<p>Out of the two the most important is Availability, with out high availability there is actually there is no reason to scale </p>

<p><b>There are several reasons for poor availability</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Resource Exhaustion  eg.. Sudden spike data coming in to system  </li>
<li>Load changes eg .. Sudden spike in number of users in the system </li>
<li>Adding lots of new features </li>
<li>Too many external dependencies </li>
<li>High Technical Debt due to aggressive bug fixes and feature development </li>
</ol>
<p>Product cannot sustain for a long time if it is suffering from frequent availability issues </p>

<p>No one can actually anticipate when a particular product will face availability issues if the entire product team considers that there product not being 100%  availabile as one of the risk and mitigate it well it will definately avoid vicious cycle of problems which impacts your bussiness </p> 

<h4>Below are techniques to keep your application availability high </h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Build with failure in mind</b> :  While building your system consider availability concerns during all aspects of your system design 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Always think in scalability perspective</b> : Build systems for tommorow meaning design your system with the ability to tolerate increased load 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Build risk matrix and mitigate them</b> : Religiously call for discussions frequently with stake holders and define Risk matrix and also in subsequent discussions re-visit mitigation plans 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Monitor availability</b> : Utilize third party tools like AppDynamics, Newrelic to monitor your servers, and configure them so that it  alerts stakeholders to trouble shoot 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Have a pre-defined troubleshooting guide</b> : This is a must, and infact an output of point 3 above, the output of risk mitigation plan is to document to reduce the seviarity of the problem.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Being prepared in advanced to handle availability concerns is the best way to reduce the likelihood and severity of availibility problems </p>
<p>I belive the techniques listed here is not a constant list, but probably it can lay a foundation for your team to comeout with a game plan as per the need </p>
