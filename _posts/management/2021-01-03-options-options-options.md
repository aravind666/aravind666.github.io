Early in my career, I worked on a system that offered users multiple ways to view the same data—grid views, list views, filters everywhere. On paper, it looked powerful.

In practice, analytics told a different story.

Users took longer to complete tasks. Features went unused. Complexity slowed them down.

Hick’s Law explains why:
> The time taken to make a decision increases logarithmically with the number of choices.

## The Product Trap

Adding features is easy. Removing them is hard—especially in enterprise software where every feature has a sponsor.

But more options don’t always mean more value. Often, they **increase cognitive load**, **reduce clarity**, and **delay decisions**.

The most effective products—and leaders—**constrain thoughtfully**.

## Leadership Insight

Simplicity is not the absence of capability. It’s the result of **intentional design**, **hard trade-offs**, and **respect for human limits**.

Sometimes, fewer options create better outcomes.
