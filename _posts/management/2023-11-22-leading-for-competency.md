After more than **15 years leading software, platform, and engineering teams**, one leadership principle has consistently separated high-performing organizations from the rest:

> **Leadership is ultimately measured by what gets done.**

Not intent.  
Not articulation.  
Not vision decks or leadership frameworks.

**Outcomes.**

I’ve read my share of leadership literature — from classical management theory to modern behavioral leadership models. While many frameworks focus heavily on *behavior*, very few address a critical dimension leaders deal with every day:

> **How should a leader adapt their behavior based on the *competence* of the people they lead?**

This post explores exactly that — not theoretically, but practically — through the lens of *getting things done at scale*.

## Clarifying the Building Blocks

Before we talk leadership behavior, we need shared clarity on a few foundational terms.

### **Skill**
A *skill* is a specific, observable capability developed through training and practice.  
Examples include:
- Designing a cloud-native architecture
- Debugging distributed systems
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines
- Operating observability platforms

Skills are **measurable, testable, and demonstrable**.

---

### **Competence**
*Competence* is broader and more consequential.

It is the **integration of skills, knowledge, judgment, and behavior** applied effectively in real-world contexts.

Competence answers questions like:
- Can this person operate independently under ambiguity?
- Can they make sound trade-offs?
- Can they execute consistently across changing constraints?

This is why interviews rely on **system design, scenario discussions, and pairing exercises** — they assess competence, not just skills.

---

### **Confidence**
Confidence reflects a person’s **self-belief in their ability to execute without constant supervision**.

---

### **Motivation**
Motivation represents **energy, intent, and willingness to engage deeply** with the work.

---

### **Commitment**
Commitment is where **confidence and motivation converge**.

> Commitment is visible.  
> Competence must be inferred holistically.

---

## The Real Bottleneck to Execution

When outcomes stall, the root cause is almost always one of two things:

> **A gap in competence — or a gap in commitment.**

An important distinction:
- **Competence is contextual** — someone can be highly competent in one domain and struggling in another.
- **Commitment is context-agnostic** — it shows up regardless of task complexity.

Recognizing this difference is a leadership superpower.

## Classifying Reality (Not People)

Every individual has **peak performance potential**.  
Effective leaders meet people *where they are* — not where they wish they were.

In most organizations, you’ll encounter these combinations:

1. **Low Competence / High Commitment**
2. **Average Competence / Low Commitment**
3. **High Competence / Average Commitment**
4. **High Competence / High Commitment**

There is one combination leaders should actively avoid hiring:

### 🚩 **Low Competence / Low Commitment**
This is not a coaching opportunity — it is a structural risk.

## Adjusting Leadership Behavior — Not Values

Leadership is not static.  
It is **situational, adaptive, and deliberate**.

Situational Leadership Theory (Hersey & Blanchard) provides a pragmatic model that maps leadership behavior to competence and commitment.

### The Four Leadership Modes

1. **Directing**  
   Clear instructions, close supervision  
   → *Low competence, high commitment*

2. **Coaching**  
   Direction + explanation + encouragement  
   → *Developing competence, low commitment*

3. **Supporting**  
   Shared decision-making, empowerment  
   → *High competence, variable commitment*

4. **Delegating**  
   Ownership, trust, autonomy  
   → *High competence, high commitment*

## The Leader’s Non-Negotiable Responsibility

Before adapting your style, ask yourself this:

> **Can I do what my team cannot do for themselves?**

If the answer is no, leadership becomes positional — not credible.

Authority in engineering leadership is earned through:
- Depth
- Judgment
- Pattern recognition
- The ability to unblock complexity

## Competence × Commitment → Leadership Behavior

| Team Characteristics | Leadership Behavior |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| Low Competence / High Commitment | Directing |
| Average Competence / Low Commitment | Coaching |
| High Competence / Average Commitment | Supporting |
| High Competence / High Commitment | Delegating |

Effective leadership is **not ideological**.  
It is **contextual, ethical, and outcome-driven**.

Great leaders:
- Adapt without compromising values
- Balance delivery with development
- Optimize for long-term capability, not short-term heroics

---

## Final Thought

To consistently **get things done**, leaders must:

- Understand competence deeply
- Read commitment accurately
- Adjust behavior intentionally

When leadership works, you’ll hear the ultimate validation:

> **“We did it ourselves.”**

That is the quiet signal of leadership done right.
