<p>

    I am using GIT since past 3 + years, to manage my source code version,
    I am a member of Github,
    I come across some strange situations which are not normal
    I research a lot to figure out the solution.
    Nowadays I found that these situations are repeating quite often
    so I decided to list them down in a place so that It could help others who are facing the same situations.

</p>

<h4>
    Situation 1 : -
</h4>
<p>I want GIT to display commit logs in one line along with graph and decoration. </p>
<pre><code class="bash">git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate</code></pre>

<p>The above command gives the below output </p>
<pre><code class="bash">

<h4>
    Situation 2 : -
</h4>
<p>
    Make existing git branch to track remote branch , say you create a branch called banyan in your local using the
    command
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
    git branch banyan
</code></pre>

<p>
    later you just push that to remote for collaboration
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
    git push origing banyan
</code></pre>

<p>
    Lets say some contributor pushes some thing to the branch banyan and later you also need to push your changes. To do
    so you need to take pull and then push, but you cannot since you dont have any local branch tracking the remote
    collaborating branch which you just pushed.
    So to solve this problem.
</p>
<pre><code class="bash">
    git branch -u origin/banyan banyan
</code></pre>

<h4>
    Situation 3 : -
</h4>
<p>
    You have to commited some large binary files to github and also pushed to the remote, later you realize that your
    repository is growing enormously, and decide to have a CDN. Once decided we delete them from the repository and
    commit .
</p>
<p>
    But there is a problem here, whenever a new stakeholder joins for collaboration, it takes lot of time to clone
    because those large binary files still exists in the repository history. Here is how we could resolve this problem.
</p>
<p>
    Lets say you are aware that you previously had /img folder with binary files, now we need to remove them from
    repository history permanently.
</p>
<pre><code class="bash">
    git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch img/" HEAD
</code></pre>
<p>
    once completed just run the below command to remove the local repository .
</p>
<pre><code class="bash">
    rm -rf .git/refs/original/ && git reflog expire --all && git gc --aggressive --prune
</code></pre>
<p>
    Just commit and push the repository. you can see the reduction in size.
</p>

<h4>
    Situation 4 : -

</h4>
<p>
    You need to checkout a partiular file from the remote tracking branch
</p>
<p>
    Just run
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
git fetch
## and later
git checkout origin/branch_name -- path_to_file/filename
</code></pre>

<h4>
    Situation 5 : -

</h4>
<p>
    you need to see the list of files in a particular branch and its current commit hash
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
    git ls-tree master
</code></pre>
