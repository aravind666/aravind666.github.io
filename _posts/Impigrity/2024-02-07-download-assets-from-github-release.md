Have you ever found yourself grappling with the task of downloading multiple GitHub release assets from a repository? I recently encountered a situation where I needed to fetch and use assets from an open-source GitHub repository, only to discover that there were more than 30 files to contend with. Fortunately, a clever shell command came to the rescue, simplifying the process and saving the day.


#### The Challenge
The GitHub release page displayed a plethora of assets, each promising to enhance the functionality of the software I was working on. However, the sheer volume of files presented a formidable challenge – downloading them individually would be time-consuming and tedious. It was at this point that I decided to leverage the power of the command line to automate the process.

#### Crafting the Solution
Here's where the magic happened. I devised a concise shell command that tapped into the GitHub API, identified the crucial "browser_download_url" key, and effortlessly downloaded the assets to a folder of my choosing. Let's break down the command step by step:

```
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/username/reponame/releases/release_id \
| grep "browser_download_url" \
| cut -d : -f 2,3 \
| tr -d \" \
| wget --show-progress -qi - -P ./destination

```
#### Breaking It Down
1. GitHub API Call:

    The command initiates with a call to the GitHub release API for the specific repository and release.

2. Extracting Download URLs:

    We use grep to isolate the "browser_download_url" key, honing in on the essential information amidst the API response.

3. Refining the URLs:

    The cut command trims the unnecessary parts of the string, leaving us with clean download URLs.
    
4. Removing Double Quotes:

    tr -d \" steps in to eliminate any lingering double quotes, ensuring a seamless transition to the next stage.

5. Downloading with wget:

    The final flourish involves piping the refined URLs to wget, a versatile tool that pulls in the assets with a visual progress display.


#### A Visual Transformation
Consider the transformation of the response strings:


```
"browser_download_url": "https://something.com/something.pdf"
"browser_download_url": "https://something.com/something1.pdf"
"browser_download_url": "https://something.com/something2.pdf"
```

Becomes:

```
"https://something.com/something.pdf"
"https://something.com/something1.pdf"
"https://something.com/something2.pdf"
```

In a stroke, the command simplifies the complex task of downloading multiple assets, providing a streamlined and efficient solution.

#### Conclusion: BINGO!

With this command in hand, downloading GitHub release assets becomes a breeze. The ability to effortlessly handle a multitude of files not only saves time but also enhances the overall development workflow. So, the next time you find yourself faced with a plethora of GitHub release assets, remember this simple shell command – your shortcut to a smoother, more efficient development experience.

Happy coding!
