<p>
    When we start building a new web application, we actually should build standards first before we plan any thing
    related to application structure or configuration or file structure etc ..
</p><p>
    So one such standard which is very much important is naming things.
</p><p>
    All stakeholders of any project should come to an agreement on how we name things through out the product life
    cycle.
</p><p>
    When I say, naming things, I meant, naming any thing, it might be your function, class , variable, file, logfile,
    vhost name, folder etc ..
</p>

<p>
    In this post I would like to list some of the best rules that I felt as good to have .
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Use no spaces when you name any thing.
    </li><li>
    Replace space with either snake case it or add underscore or you an add an hypen but not recommended .
</li>
    <li>
    Keep it short, and meaningful, for eg, instead of calling a function as clear_data_from_tables, you can say bus_tables, Here you can observe bus means clean and it actually make sense but little difficult but still it is short and meaningfull .
    </li>
    <li>
    Do not append numbers, for example if we have a function called  clear_data1 and another function called clear_data2 with different functionality, then its really bad because it is a pain in the ass for any person who works on this code in future.
    </li>
    <li>
    Try to name as much as possible with lowercase, because uppercase characters has its own platform and language specific status.
    </li>
    <li>
    Make sure what ever files that you expect application to create has some extension, it helps a lot during debugging.
    </li>
    <li>
    Use only alphanumeric characters
    </li>
    <li>
    Last but not least,  Make sure every stackholder follows this
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    One interesting question, is expected, i.e
</p>

        <blockquote>
            Why should we name things well ?
        </blockquote>
<p>
    Software development is all about, describing and expressing solutions. When we join a project as a stakeholder,
    then first thing what we see is the code or technical specifications or an UML diagram or best case Agile User
    stories.

</p>
<p>
    When we see them the only means that we can get insights about the application functionality is by exploiting the
    naming system which is followed. So that works as a capsule for any new guy entering the project, and the capsule is
    built by the team who started the application from scratch by having ground rules to name things.

</p>
<p>
    If you have ever reviewed some of the postings in <a href="http://www.codingconfessional.com/">codingconfessional.com</a> most of the postings are indirectly related
    to naming.

</p>
<p>
    The best way to learn to name things is by renaming things as much as possible and testing its readability and
    simplicity with the stakeholders :)
