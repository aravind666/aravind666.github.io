=============

I have created this repository to build my own personal Blog.

This is my personal website, it's a collection of superficial piecemeal knowledge of my own on Technology, Programming, Process, Patterns, Platforms and Frameworks. I am a software developer currently specializing in building high quality scalable applications on Web as well as Mobile by using SDLC methodologies like Agile and by applying Object oriented design principles like SOLID, I'm currently employed full-time and not open for consulting, but you can learn more about me and also read my blog posts .
