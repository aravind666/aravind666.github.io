                    I strongly believe that we human beings are bad in doing repetitive things, That is the reason a <a class="kesari-text" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">genius among us had Invented Programmable Computers</a>.
                    We modern day programmers are usually equipped by powerful <a class="kesari-text" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator">Operating System terminals</a> which usually runs some or the other powerful <a class="kesari-text" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell"> programmable command interpreter like shell </a>.
                    I have personally repented and ranted a lot on doing some repetitive manual work. With all frustrations, I use to spend some time on figuring out some ways to prevent doing repetitive manual work.
                    So that I could avoid inefficient and non productive approaches. The catalog of Impigrity which I recently started is a place where I publish my ways of getting things done with Impigrity.
