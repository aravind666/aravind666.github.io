        <h1 class="display-5">The Story Of Aravind On Software</h1>
        <p class="lead">I started this website, In 2010 when I was working for <a class="kesari-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.costrategix.com/">CoStrategix</a> as a Senior Software Analyst.
            I had one horrible habit of writing journals on what happened on my professional life on daily basis,
            sometimes I was so crazy that I minute word by word, phrase by phrase on some interesting conversations and arguments and self reflect on them.
            Anything which I came across as a gap in my understanding I usually do detail research on filling that gap irrespective of the domain and context.
            Post doing a research I use to add the notes to the same journal to track things.
            The posts published in <a class="kesari-link" href="http://www.aravindhu.com/">"Aravind On Software"</a>  are the same notes which were part of my journal .
            I have polished them a bit to make sure, who ever who reads them can make best use of it.

            The name <a class="kesari-link" href="http://www.aravindhu.com/">"Aravind On Software"</a> was inspired by <a class="kesari-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/">"Joel On Software"</a>  by <a class="kesari-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/about-me/">Mr Joel Spolsky</a>, whom I consider
            as the most thoughtful writers on software development, I would strongly recommend to read his books to get enlightened.
