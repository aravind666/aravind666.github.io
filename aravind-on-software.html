                The Story Of Aravind On Software

                    I started this website in <strong>2010</strong> when I was working for <a href="https://www.costrategix.com/" target="_blank" style="color: var(--nature-green); font-weight: 600;">CoStrategix</a> as a Senior Software Analyst.
                    I had one horrible habit of writing journals on what happened in my professional life on a daily basis.
                    Sometimes I was so crazy that I would write minute by minute, word by word, phrase by phrase on some interesting conversations and arguments, and self-reflect on them.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    Anything which I came across as a gap in my understanding, I usually did detailed research on filling that gap irrespective of the domain and context.
                    After doing research, I would add the notes to the same journal to track things.
                    The posts published in <a href="/" style="color: var(--nature-green); font-weight: 600;">"Aravind On Software"</a> are the same notes which were part of my journal.
                    I have polished them a bit to make sure whoever reads them can make best use of it.

                        The name <a href="/" style="color: var(--nature-green); font-weight: 600;">"Aravind On Software"</a> was inspired by <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/" target="_blank" style="color: var(--nature-green); font-weight: 600;">"Joel On Software"</a> by <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/about-me/" target="_blank" style="color: var(--nature-green); font-weight: 600;">Mr Joel Spolsky</a>, whom I consider one of the most thoughtful writers on software development. I would strongly recommend reading his books to get enlightened.
